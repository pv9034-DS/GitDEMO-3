## 📝 Tasks

### 🔹 Task 1: Factorial Function (Recursion)
A Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument  
2. Uses **recursion** to calculate the factorial  
3. Returns the calculated factorial  
4. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the result  

# Sample number
<br>
num = 6
<br>
print(f"Factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}")
<br>
Example Output:
<br>
Factorial of 6 is: 720

### 🔹 Task 2: Math Module Operations
A Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input  
2. Uses the `math` module to calculate:  
   - Square root of the number  
   - Natural logarithm (log base *e*) of the number  
   - Sine of the number (in radians)  
3. Displays the calculated results  

**Example Output:**
<br>
Enter a number: 9
<br>
Square root of 9.0 is: 3.0
<br>
Natural logarithm of 9.0 is: 2.1972245773362196
<br>
Sine of 9.0 (in radians) is: 0.4121184852417566
